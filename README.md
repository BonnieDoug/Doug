This is currently very much a work in porgress application. Eventually it is intended to be a learning resource aimed at teaching howto use Symfony3, Doctrine and a bunch of other web technologies. In the form of a Blog, to make the very website the user read, the blog on. I'm currently in the process of documenting every stage of the build, as I work through the develoment. Hopefully, real life permitting, the project will be complete soon.
